# FitLife

This is a project application for our mobile programming course. It is meant to be a fitness app that demonstrates our skills in coding.
The app is not suitable for launch but is good proof of decent coding skills. We hope whoever uses this repository is able to benefit
from it in some way, as there are many concepts to learn from here. We sure learned a lot.

The main page of the app has the following main features: 
  - Calorie counter
  - BMI calculator
  - Water consumption tally
  
  The calorie counter is used by clicking on the calories consumed button on the home page and adding in the food items consumed for the day
  The BMI is automatically calculated after entering the details required in the profile page
  The water consumption is tallied with the plus and minus buttons on the home page
  
The profile page allows the user to create a proile for themselves using the following information: 
  - Name
  - Birthday
  - Weight
  - Height
  
The category page allows the user to add and edit new categories in which they can add workouts that suit these categories
